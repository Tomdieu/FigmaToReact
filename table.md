## Figma to React Component Mapping Table:

| Figma Concept                       | React Component or Concept        | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `FigmaApp`                          | `ReactApplication`               | Represents the overall React app, holds the pages and router.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Document`                         | `Page`                             | A Figma Document, or a figma page, is mapped to a React `Page` which represents a single page in the app, holds its content and route path, and is a child of the React application.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `Canvas`                            | `div`  |  Renders the parent elements of a `Page`. May need further styling depending on the `Document` structure.                                                                                     |
| `Frame`                             | `div`                              |  Represents a container element. We will be using CSS flexbox for layout (handling `layoutMode` is the tricky part). Attributes like `itemSpacing`, `primaryAxisAlignItems`, `counterAxisAlignItems` will be translated to CSS flexbox properties. `cornerRadius`, `cornerSmoothing` will translate into border radius.                                     |
| `Rectangle`                         | `div`                              | Represents a basic rectangular shape, will be translated into div with the proper background, dimensions, border radius (from `cornerRadius`, `cornerSmoothing`  properties) and other styling.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Text`                              | `p` or `span`                      | Renders text content. We might use `<p>` for paragraphs and `<span>` for inline text, depending on context. We have to map the `Style` properties to React inline styles. (e.g. `fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `letterSpacing`, `lineHeightPercent`, etc). Also `paddingBottom`, `paddingLeft`, `paddingRight`, `paddingTop` should be mapped to style.   |
| `Line` |  `div` or other HTML elements (e.g `<hr/>`) | A line element. It should be rendered as a `<hr/>` or div styled with `border-top` or `border-bottom` (depending on its position)                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `Component`                         | `FunctionalComponent`               | Maps a Figma component definition to a React functional component, this will require the mapping of the children, props, states.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Instance`                          | Component Usage                    | Maps to the usage of React component with the right set of props (component properties) and overrides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `COMPONENT_SET`                |  `div` |  Represents a set of components with a layout. We can map it as a `div` with the style property that manages the layout.                                                     |
| `Style`                            | inline style attribute                |  Figma text style definitions will be translated to inline styles in the react component. (font properties, line height, text alignment, etc.)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Color`                             | `string` (CSS color)              | The color information will be converted to CSS color strings (e.g., `rgba(r, g, b, a)`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `LayoutGrid`                       | No Direct Mapping         |  Layout Grids will not have a direct mapping, as grids can be achieved by CSS Flexbox. It will need some logic to translate to CSS flexbox properties, that will be applied to its parent element.                                                                                                                                       |
| `Constraints`                       | CSS Flexbox properties  |  Constraint properties like vertical and horizontal will be used to align the element with the flexbox properties on its parent.                                                     |
| `PrototypeDevice`                  | No Direct Mapping                     | This can be used to define viewport size or add custom styling for a device. For now, we will ignore this property, but later can be taken into account for responsive design.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Trigger` / `Action` / `Transition` |  Event Handlers and Navigation  | We will try to map actions like `onClick` events on buttons or navigation on menu items. We should revisit this when we have the basic UI done.                                                                                                                                                                           |
|`Background` | CSS background properties  | The properties of the background will be mapped to CSS properties in its parent element.  |
| `Dimensions`                        | Inline Styles (width, height, etc.) | Attributes like `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` will be mapped to inline style attributes, which will help position and size elements. |
|`BlendMode`| CSS properties | The properties of blend mode will be mapped to CSS properties  in its parent element. |
|`Stroke`| CSS border properties | The properties of strokes will be mapped to CSS border properties in its parent element. |
|`Effect` | CSS filter properties | The effect property will be mapped to CSS filter property on its parent element. |

**Key Considerations:**

* **Abstraction:**  This is an abstract mapping and it is only intended to be a starting point. We might need to add extra elements for specific cases.
* **Flexibility:**  The mapping is designed to be flexible, where it's possible to map the same Figma element in different ways, based on the design and development requirements of our project.
* **Simplifications:** The table is simplified and does not consider all Figma elements, or React features. We will add more as required by the transformation.
* **CSS Styling:** We are initially targeting inline styles for simplicity.
* **Data Handling:** We need to clarify how component properties are handled, specially how to translate the emaps to props.
